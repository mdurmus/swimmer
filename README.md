# Swimmer

<p>Swimmers is the website of an imaginary swimming association. The aim of this association is to raise awareness by informing people about the sport of swimming and to encourage people to take up the sport. For those who do swimming, it aims to provide information about some swimming styles and to apply the techniques correctly. </p>

<p>At first glance; our website provides information about the swimmers club and presents the text of a policy. It explains the benefits of swimming and why we should choose to swim. It lists the advantages of different types of swimming. And a contact form allows you to get in touch. And of course you can access detailed information through the social media pages. </p>

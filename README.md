# Swimmer

Swimmers is the website of an imaginary swimming association. The aim of this association is to raise awareness by informing people about the sport of swimming and to encourage people to take up the sport. For those who do swimming, it aims to provide information about some swimming styles and to apply the techniques correctly.

At first glance; our website provides information about the swimmers club and presents the text of a policy. It explains the benefits of swimming and why we should choose to swim. It lists the advantages of different types of swimming. And a contact form allows you to get in touch. And of course you can access detailed information through the social media pages.

## Site Owner's Goal

With the number of members increasing day by day, it will be the biggest gain for site owners to expand their social networks with each other. And of course, they will feel the justified joy of contributing to world health by inviting people to be healthy.It can also be itemized as follows:

+ To provide the user with information about the benefits of swimming, with a particular focus on mental, physical and spiritual well-being.
+ Each type of swimming type provides the user with a list of breathing techniques, muscle groups and advantages over other types under three headings.
+ To provide a user-friendly website that makes you feel like you are swimming in water with the use of responsive and appropriate colors and images.
+ Finally, with a form object, users can be informed about both their messages and the type of swimming they are interested in.

## Design

When it comes to site design, we should remember two main topics: Visual design and coding design. For coded design, two different declarative languages are used: HTML and CSS.

### Code Design

You can find detailed information about HTML <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/">here</a> and CSS <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">here</a>.

### Visual Design

#### Imagery
The visuals used on the Swimmers site are very important in terms of the message to the user. All the images use swimming pools, sometimes indoors and sometimes outdoors. There is also a video that conveys the message that they can venture out to the open seas and experience the richness of nature forever. This has great benefits for mental health and evokes in the user a sense of the importance of experience and experimentation. The predominant colors are blue and green, colors that convey peace and a sense of movement. It is important because it ties in with the main color scheme of the site.

### Colours

The color scheme of the website is blue, green and its shades, using various shades of green to represent the peacefulness that comes from nature. 

The color blue is often considered the color of the ocean and the sky; it is often a symbol of peace, stability, inspiration or wisdom. It can be a calming color and symbolizes reliability.

In order to achieve a good contrast ratio, shades of blue, green and black are used on a white background to make it easier for the user to read. 

### Fonts

The ***Libre Franklin*** font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were produced using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq.</a>

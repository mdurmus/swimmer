                            <strong>Differences of Freestyle Swimming Compared to Other Styles in 3 Key Aspects:</strong>
                            
                            <h4>Body Position and Flexibility</h4>
                            <p>Freestyle swimming allows for greater flexibility and comfort in body position. Swimmers often swim on their backs, providing a more flexible body movement compared to other styles. This allows swimmers to progress through the water in a more natural and fluid manner.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Breathing Techniques</h4>
                            <p>Freestyle swimming typically involves lateral (side) breathing techniques. This allows swimmers to turn their heads to the side to breathe. Other swimming styles often adopt forward or backward breathing techniques. The lateral breathing feature of freestyle enables swimmers to breathe more effectively and continuously.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Arm Techniques and Speed</h4>
                            <p> Freestyle relies on symmetrical arm movements. Other swimming styles, such as butterfly, may involve more complex or different types of arm movements. The simple and symmetrical arm technique of freestyle allows swimmers to progress through the water with less resistance, achieving higher speeds.</p>

                            <strong>Three Key Differences of Butterfly Swimming Compared to Other Styles:</strong>
                            
                            <h4>Technical Challenge and Coordination</h4>
                            <p>Butterfly style requires symmetrical wave movements where the swimmer moves their arms simultaneously up and down. Other swimming styles often involve more asymmetrical or different arm movements. Butterfly style presents a more challenging approach in terms of coordination and technical precision compared to other styles.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Breathing Techniques</h4>
                            <p>In butterfly swimming, swimmers typically breathe by lifting their heads above the water. This is a different breathing technique compared to other traditional styles. For instance, freestyle and backstroke generally involve breathing from the side. Butterfly style offers a unique approach to breathing.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Foot Techniques and Force:</h4>
                            <p>Butterfly style includes a specific foot technique known as the dolphin kick. In this technique, the feet are joined together, and a wave-like motion propels the water. Other swimming styles usually employ different foot techniques. Butterfly style stands out in the use of force generated from the feet.</p>

                            <strong>Advantages of Breaststroke Swimming Compared to Other Styles:</strong>
                            
                            <h4>Low Energy Expenditure and Comfort</h4>
                            <p>Breaststroke typically requires less energy compared to other techniques. The swimmer uses their legs to propel and move comfortably through the water. This can result in energy savings, especially for those swimming longer distances.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Ease of Breathing</h4>
                            <p>Breaststroke allows swimmers to breathe more comfortably. Unlike other styles that may require the swimmer to face another direction in the water, breaststroke permits the swimmer to easily lift their head above the water for breathing. This facilitates a more comfortable and continuous breathing pattern.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Lower Risk of Injury</h4>
                            <p>Breaststroke may exert less strain on joints compared to some other swimming styles. Styles like backstroke or butterfly may pose higher risks of strain and stress, especially on the shoulders and back. Breaststroke, with its lower impact levels, might positively influence joint health.</p>

                            <strong>Advantages of Backstroke Swimming Compared to Other Styles:</strong>
                            
                            <h4>Ease of Breathing</h4>
                            <p>Backstroke involves a position where the swimmer is on their back, allowing for easy breathing. This position enables the swimmer to breathe comfortably and position their neck more freely. In contrast, some other styles may make breathing more challenging with the head submerged underwater.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Spinal and Neck Comfort</h4>
                            <p>Backstroke imposes lower impact levels on the spine and neck. Other techniques, especially styles like butterfly, may create more stress and strain on the spine and neck. Backstroke can reduce stress in these areas, providing a more comfortable option for swimmers on their back.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Watch the sky</h4>
                            <p>Backstroke allows the swimmer to see the surface of the water and better focus on the surrounding environment. This enhances the swimmer's ability to assess distance and direction more effectively. In other styles, where the swimmer typically faces downward, environmental awareness may be reduced.</p>
